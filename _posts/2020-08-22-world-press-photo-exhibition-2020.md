I went to the State Library of NSW today for [said photography exhibition](https://www.sl.nsw.gov.au/exhibitions/world-press-photo-exhibition-2020). It did not disappoint.

I partially blame the analogue experience. Moving from piece to piece. Having to absorbing the pieces in a format larger than a typical screen. Traversing the whole building (and town) to see the thing.

You know you're living in a new era when going out to see something you can see online is a struggle, and the analogue experience itself is a highlight.

The photos (and accompanying stories) that struck me the most, in no particular order:

- [The dead baby orangutan](https://www.worldpressphoto.org/collection/photo/2020/39641/1/Alain-Schroeder-NA)
- [The man about to slaughter an endangered pangolin](https://www.worldpressphoto.org/collection/photo/2020/39645/9/Brent-Stirton-NAS-IJ)
- [The border wall](https://www.worldpressphoto.org/collection/photo/2020/39639/1/Alejandro-Prieto)
- [The Flamengo father and son](https://www.worldpressphoto.org/collection/photo/2020/39655/1/Silvia-Izquierdo)
- [The Japanese 80 year old rugby players](https://www.worldpressphoto.org/collection/photo/2020/39657/1/Kim-Kyung-Hoon)
- [The crater made from melting permafrost](https://www.worldpressphoto.org/collection/photo/2020/39625/1/Katie-Orlinsky)
