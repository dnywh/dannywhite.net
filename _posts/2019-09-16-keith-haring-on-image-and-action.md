Lexi and I visited the Guggenheim over the weekend.

My favourite thing in the museum wasn't a piece of art—it was a page from Keith Haring's [journals book](http://www.haring.com/!/archives/journals). Emphasis added by me:

> My main problem with the computer is the restriction of the image, in that it is always trapped inside this box (on a screen) and, except in the printing, is very limited in its scale.

> I was, however, interested in the tactile experience of drawing, which is very different on a computer. Time-lapse (and/or spacial displacement) occurs when a "mouse" is used to draw. This displacement of image and action creates a new problem to be solved by the "drawer". The drawer then has the added ability to take the image and manipulate its color, size, and placement. **The image becomes a workable entity restricted only by the limitations of the computer program, programmer, and the screen of the monitor itself**.

> There are endless possibilities to be investigated in this area.

Honestly, I don't fully get what he means. He seems to be going back-and-forth on whether the computer is restrictive or not. What attracts me is his highlighting of something we now take for granted: computers are forgiving; things can be endlessly undone, redone, and changed.

Haring attributes this ability to the _indirect_ manipulation nature of the computer(s) he knew. We now live in an age where image and action are one. (think Apple Pencil and iPad, for example). We now have endless manipulation of what is now _direct_ manipulation.

I'm trying to get back into shooting with my X-T10. Below are some rusty shots from the day.
