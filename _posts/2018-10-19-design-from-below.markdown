We're in the middle of a revolution in design tooling right now. They're making [Kickstarter]() [projects](), [Forbes]()... Yet at times, design tools feels like _all_ we're talking about within the design community. Oddly, the even-more-rapid context in which what we make is used is rarely discussed or misunderstood. It's odd because it's ultimately what we're serving. I have some thoughts on how we can do that better/flip this around.

This is something I've been mulling over for the past year or two. [Loupe 2018]() forced me to take this out of my brain and make it comprehendable. So here it is.

> A comparison of our, digital design, situation with that of urban design in the 1900s. Diving deep on some of the flawed assumptions of High Modernism and how it’s the easy path for us if we’re not careful.

> Focusing on the context of our tools rather than the tools themselves; how the things we make are used, in what situations, and how to be an optimist about it all.

<!-- ## The print-design dichotomy -->

The tools we're using come from print design.

## Source of truth

> Should designers code?

We're more like the Fab Five.

## We're not the first
