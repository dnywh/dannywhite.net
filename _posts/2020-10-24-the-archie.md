This was my first year seeing the Archibald, Wynne, and Sulman Prizes.

Here’s what it looked like:

That one on the right reminds me of [a model](https://github.com/taki0112/SPADE-Tensorflow) I was recently noodling on via [RunwayML](https://app.runwayml.com/models/sree_harsha/SPADE-FACE). You tell the computer to generate realistic facial features by distinguishing which feature is which through colour. I'd like to test this out with scanned-in paintings.
