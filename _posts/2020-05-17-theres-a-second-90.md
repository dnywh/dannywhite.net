I finished another isolation project yesterday: [68 Bits of Unsolicited Advice, One At a Time](https://68.netlify.app). It's based on Kevin Kelly's [original article by the same name](https://kk.org/thetechnium/68-bits-of-unsolicited-advice/).

It took me a fair bit longer than I estimated: 20 odd hours instead of 12. Towards the end of it, whilst testing stuff, I came across this:

  <img data-src="https://ik.imagekit.io/dw/notes/theres-a-second-90/be-prepared.jpeg" alt="Be prepared: When you are 90% done any large project (a house, a film, an event, an app) the rest of the myriad details will take a second 90% to complete.">

90% of 12 hours is 10.8 hours. Following the _*_there's another 90% after the first 90% rule_: two sets of 10.8 hours equals 21.6 hours.

That's pretty spot-on.
