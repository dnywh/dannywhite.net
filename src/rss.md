The world is going mad one tweet at a time. We don't need those predatory platforms, but we do want a way to follow the work of people we're interested in. RSS is the way to do that. What's old is new.

This website is where I jot down ideas and experiments. If you want to stay abreast, open [this link](https://dannywhite.net/feed.xml) or copy the below to your RSS reader of choice:

## What's RSS?

If you've listened to a podcast, you've used RSS. Honestly, you don't need to know much more about it. Just know that you can follow blogs, podcasts, or whatever else you like. When they publish something new, that new thing will appear quietly in your RSS reader.

## RSS readers

My favourite is [Reeder Classic](https://reeder.app/classic). There are a bunch out there. Just try a few out.
