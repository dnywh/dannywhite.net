**Sunday to Tuesday:** watch [Adolescence](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence_(TV_series)>) portray Instagram as the breeding ground for cyberbullying, misogyny, and real-world violence.

**Wednesday to Saturday:** watch [Meta](https://about.fb.com/news/2025/09/introducing-vibes-ai-videos/) and [OpenAI](https://openai.com/index/sora-2/) announce their respective social platforms for creating deepfake videos of your friends or idols doing compromising things.
