Kenny Pittock had an piece at the NGA called _52 Shopping lists found while working at a supermarket_. I stumbled across the exhibition whilst I was living in Melbourne, almost exactly two years ago. I remember the discovery being like catnip given my [continuing obsession with Ephemera](http://ephemera.dannywhite.net).

My friend Jess just reminded me of this exhibition so I went back to look it up. Here’s what I missed despite seeing it in-person:

<figure class="quote">
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      Each sculpture is hand sculpted from earthenware clay and kiln fired.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
</figure>

These aren’t just notes picked up from the supermarket floor. These are _earthenware clay recreations_.
