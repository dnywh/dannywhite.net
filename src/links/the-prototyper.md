My friend Shane Allen on why prototyping matters:

"The truth is, there’s nothing quite like holding an idea in your hand, something you can tap, swipe, and feel through the screen. Static mocks can only take you so far. A working prototype can validate (or invalidate) ideas fast, surface edge cases you hadn’t considered, cut through stakeholder doubt, align teams faster, and most importantly, unlock meaningful user feedback before it’s too late."
