quote: "The original promise of personal computing was a new kind of clay—a malleable material that users could reshape at will. Instead, we got appliances: built far away, sealed, unchangeable. When your tools don’t work the way you need them to, you submit feedback and hope for the best. You’re forced to adapt your workflow to fit your software, when it should be the other way around."

I often think about how the best tools, apps, whatever are ones that give the user agency. A camera, notebook and pen, copy of Photoshop, chisel, saw, all put you into _producer_ mode.

The worst technologies put you into the opposite: a sort of _consumer_ mode. You're passively taking in other people’s production. TikTok, Instagram, terrestrial TV.
