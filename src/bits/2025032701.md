[Attie](https://www.attie.app/) now remembers which sport and competitions you last had selected, and will default to them upon arrival. It even remembers the competitions you had selected for other sports, should you flick between them.

No accounts, no databases, no preferences to juggle. Just automatic, behind-the-scenes work in your browser.

This is possible thanks to the `localStorage` property, which lets websites save some basic text on the visitorâ€™s device, like so:

```js
localStorage.setItem("selectedSport", "football");
```

Sure, you might need to re-enter your selected sport and competitions from time to time. Like if you open Attie on a new device. But this feels much simpler than the account-based alternative, which I was pretty close to making.

And probably quicker than signing in, too.

Keep It Simple, Stupid.
