The slow drift of indie writers, makers, and artists to Substack is so weird to me. They often already have a website or newsletter yet choose to get flattened into a doomed algo, fighting for scraps.

What's going on? The allure of supposed reach? I don't buy the "itâ€™s just easier" argument. Anyone can spin up a domain, blog, and/or newsletter for a few dollars without touching code.

My guess is that Substack seems like a shortcut to reaching more eyeballs. Never mind the quality of those eyeballs.

But we've already seen this play out, a few times. Just look at the slop pumped out on every other over-saturated social network. (Yes, Substack is a social network.)

I'm not sure that 'reach' is a problem to solve. Maybe it's a good thing if only a dozen people find and stick with your newsletter.
