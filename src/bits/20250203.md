Have you ever seen a more delightful ampersand?

<figure>
  <img src="{% extSrc 'bits/borgman-augustinus' %}"
  srcset="{% extSrcset 'bits/borgman-augustinus' %}"
  alt="A office window signpainted with the phrase 'Borgman & Augustinus Casting Directors'. The Ampersand is holding a camera."

Spotted in the Netherlands, of course.
