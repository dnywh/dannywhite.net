We're in the middle of a revolution in design tooling right now. Yet at times, design tools feels like _all_ we're talking about within the design community. Oddly, the even-more-rapid context in which what we make is used is rarely discussed or misunderstood. It's odd because it's ultimately what we're serving. I have some thoughts on how we can do that better/flip this around.

This is something I've been mulling over for the past year or two. Loupe 2018 forced me to take this out of my brain and make it comprehendible. So here it is...

I've written a condensed version for your reading pleasure and (mostly) for my own archiving. Enjoy.

## Reality check

I grew into digital design through Photoshop, and Paint before that. Today, I rely on newer, built-for-digital-design tools like Sketch and Figma. I'd argue that all of these—including Sketch—are inherintely (and accidentally) print design tools.

Gutenburg 7th century, China before that, movable type, the printing press... All of these tools that we're (still) using even through desktop publishing come from a world where designers set the type, mixed the colours, handled the paper stock.

**We kept on using these same print tools through to digital interface design—except to make _models_; high fidelity models of the actual thing.**

I think we always knew this, and then tools like the original Framer exposed this workflow is indeed backwards. Then the question of 2016 came along and made it even more palpable:

> Should designers code?

It's a poor question because it equated code as another model-making tool. The _intent_ of the question however is quite interesting:

> How do we (designers) work with code?

We're recognising as a community that we're pushing and pulling to and from the same source as our engineers. It's not about which tool we interface with to wrangle code—or whether we do so directly—the output is shared and therefore the same.

We're certainly not the first to have this realisation. The games industry for example has historically worked in this way. You might have:

- level designers
- programmers
- animators
- environment artists
- SFX specialists
- lighting specialists

...all building upon each-others work. It's kind of hard to visually represent this, so I've come up with the best analogy I could...

### The Fab Five model

Queer Eye is a great lesson on humanity. It's also a great lesson on collaboration.

{% include media-grid.html
  type="single-right"
  caption="Bobby, Karamo, Antony, Jonathan, Tan."
  media="
  fab-five.jpg" %}

These guys do something similar to the games industry—except the medium is a human being. Each member has their own individual expertise and tools, yet work concurrently on the same subject. Antony will be prepping a meal plan whilst Jonathan is doing the guy's grooming, whilst Bobby is grabbing a few things at the hardware store. They'll check in and out, both with the central subject and eachother.

### Surrounding context

If you've seen an episode you know the haircut and the house are not the lasting takeaways. It's almost always the _softer_ output; the life transformation brought about by virtue of the Fab Five's technical skillsets.

It's this softer output that _we_ need to be aware of (and arguably building for) in our world, too. Interface design workflows and tooling are being disrupted like never before—as are the social and cultural implications of what they help build. Think about the way that you last:

- rented a movie
- said happy birthday to a friend
- found and organised that last date
- had food show up to your house
- found your current place of work

We were asking a technical question with _"should designers code?"_ and ended up with an overwhelming answer.

1. Our tooling has changed dramatically.
2. Our audience is now the entire world. Digital interfaces are commonplace, even in developing countries.
3. Our roles are broadening to include product and organisational leadership.

Luckily, we're not the first design discipline to go through this kind of transformation...

## Pouring slabs

Not too far from central Amsterdam is an incredible piece of living history; the Bijlmermeer.

{% include media-grid.html

  media="
  bijlmermeer-1962-73.jpg" %}

The Bijlmermeer was conceived-of and built as the design of built environment was facing a transformation from multiple fronts:

1. Revolutionary tooling, materials, and construction methods (such as reinforced concrete) reached maturity.
2. People and cities across the world were generally urbanising, and post-war cities re-structuring.
3. Architects because formally responsible for the health and safety of the people who interacted with and inhabited the buildings that they designed.

As well as being built at this time, the Bijlmermeer is also an example of a specific _approach_ to urban design. One with an **unrelenting belief on technological progress alone to advance the human condition**. An approach that I worry interface designers are moving towards. An approach with a lot to do with Le Corbusier.

Le Corbusier's vision for High Modernist design came to him whilst overlooking Paris from an aeroplane. That speaks volumes about its philosophy; if things can be standardised and made perfect from a technological point of view, then they should be duplicated down to the screw size—wherever it will be implemented across the world.

This is his rendition of a future Buenos Aires, drawn from well-off the coast of the city:

He drew the following sketch shortly after a flight over Rio De Janerio:

And this last one breaks my heart. If you've been to Paris, maybe it breaks yours, too. This is his blueprint for his Radiant City—specifically applied to Paris.

{% include image.html name="radiant-city-plans.jpg" caption="The Radiant City." %}

Le Corbusier's urban utopia; high-rise buildings (in the distance) for the optimal work environment. Medium-rise buildings (in the mid to-foreground) for the perfect living conditions. Massive vistas (taking up most of the middle) for leisure. Superhighways connecting these three purpose-built environments and their _superblocks_ as there is no concept of a footpath or gradual transition between zones.

_Radiant City_ is his seminal book on this philosophy and proposed city. It's well worth a read. For example, the below gem illustrates exactly how his superblocks compare to blocks that existed in historic cities (and for these examples, thankfully still do to a degree).

The Bijlmermeer wasn't built by Le Corbusier but it was done in his footsteps—within the school of high modernity.

### Designing from above

I believe the intentions of the designers of the Bijlmermeer and Le Corbusier were actually quite good; they were ultimately about improving the human condition. The naivity in the _designing from above_ methodology is only made obvious in hindsight—after these places have been built and interacted with.

Designing from above is actually the antithesis of what people need. We are complex beings that do not deal well with reduction regimentation in our interactions.

Brasilia and the Bijlmermeer, two environments built from above, shared a strange phenomenon that illustrates this well. Residents of both consistently had difficulty in finding their own apartment or setting a recognisable meeting place.

Sadly, there are more severe examples of how this methodology has failed people. The infamous Pruitt-Igoe in St Louis was one of them.

{% include media-grid.html
  type="single-right"
  caption="United States Geological Survey, 1963–72."
  media="
  pruitt-igoe-USGS02.jpg" %}

Pruitt-Igoe was a housing development designed and built from a blank slate. Notice the surrounding tenement buildings in the photo above; to understand a key reason for its demise, we need to consider what Pruitt-Igoe replaced.

I live in New York so like to use New York examples. This first photo below was taken on Hester Street, on the Lower East Side. The second photo was taken from somewhere around Alphabet City. Although heavily gentrified, both areas still generally maintain their structure and density.

  type="even"
  caption="First: Berenice Abbott, 1936. Second: Vergara, Camilo J, 1970."
  media="

  vergara-camilo.jpg" %}

Their structure and density are similar to that of the tenement buildings Pruitt-Igoe replaced. Buildings with eclectic groups of people, of all ages, on the street. Shops, street venders, and stoops. Mischief.

The kids playing with a fire hydrant are not at school or at home—nor are they in a defined play-area. These diverse interactions occurring on a sidewalk-facing street are complex and seemingly chaotic **because they are, and because _we_ are too**.

**Designers tend to conflate complexity with disorder**. We have a hard time mapping organic interactions and often avoid it all together. It's only natural that this organic, decentralised, urban design is to blame for social and economic problems in St Louis.

Pruitt-Igoe set out to be Le Corbusier's urban utopia but ended up prematurely yet spectacularly demolished (on live television).

  pruitt-igoe-collapse-series-4.jpg" %}

I don't think there's a Pruitt Igoe, Bijlmermeer, or Brasilia of product design, but I do worry that the failures made by their designers are ones we could also make. In our world we _have_ to simplify and systemise just to be able to work with our already-abstracted design tools and our computers—let alone design something coherent that fits into the palm of a hand.

Designing from above is an easy option for us.

## Designing from below

In a similar window of time as Le Corbusier and Robert Moses was Jane Jacobs; an architectural journalist, author, and hardcore urban activist rooted in Greenwich Village. Jane Jacobs was an expert in what makes good urban design and a significant figure in New York City history.

{% include media-grid.html

  media="
  jane-jacobs.jpg" %}

One of my favourite Jane Jacobs is this:

> The best way to plan for downtown is to see how people use it today.

With _our_ new ways of working, mixed with some Jane Jacobs awareness, I believe product designers are actually in a good position to steer towards designing with context—designing from below.

### Designing with data

There are obviously different degrees to this, but it turns out that even the easy one has a lot of wins for us. And being a design (tools) conference, I'm sure a lot of you already do this with injecting data, or data into avatars and strings, but there's actually a whole lot of different degrees we can do this _within_ an easy degree. Because if we inform our interfaces inherently from whatever our downtowns are, it produces something that actually reflects the people we're making it for.

This also can extend itself to using the same hard hardware, the same software, the same network speeds even as the people you're designing for—because it's probably different from what you use.

### Leaving the office

But of course to be more true to Jane Jacobs; those of who can, should be able to leave the office and take our increasingly mobile/remote setup and physically embed ourselves in the communities that we're designing for.

It can be hard to justify sitting on a park bench to your colleagues or your bosses or maybe, but that kind of ethnographic research is invaluable. And like designing with data, this inform what we're doing from the very beginning and not be something that we stress test or do at the very end.

I have another New York example. This is Times Square; still kind of looks like this from some angles.

{% include image.html name="times-square.jpg" caption="From left: Hiroko Masuike, Damon Winter, Justin Maxon, 2009, for The New York Times." %}

This is from one day in 2009. The then-transport commissioner and her team they as an experiment shut down 5 blocks to cars. They went to the local hardware store, picked up some paint and lawn chairs, and set them out. People turned out, started to hang out, and then they had to go and buy some more lawn chairs.

This temporary plaza was so successful it was eventually made permanent.

### Embracing difference

I'm showing you this because this an artefact of the design of built environment learning from its past and making changes. This design process was informed by city data, prototyped on the cheap with cheap materials, and involved a mix of people to get right.

Only by having different people on our teams do we really have the diversity of thought that we need to make things that really resonate with our different audiences. And so as the makers, advocates, users, and stewards of tools we are responsible for ensuring they are open to our non-traditional designer and non-designer teammates.

## Git push

High Modernity, for all its faults, was a legitimate response to what was happening in the world at its ascendency, 50–60 years ago. What we're making now is impacting the world severely. Good and bad. It's used by people to decide who to vote for or how or why to take action on a complex issue like climate change. People use what we make to meet their life partners. And as their primary form of communication.

This is a lot, but ultimately I'm an optimist about this. Because our digital medium has something that the design of built environment _doesn't_ have, and it's why places likes the Bijlmermeer or Brasilia are still around in their flawed form. It takes generations to suffer through, and then eventually modify or replace bad urban design. But in our world, we can make strides; we can go to our streets and design from below, and put it in peoples' hands next week. And then we can do the same thing the week after.
