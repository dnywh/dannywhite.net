## Process
It all started with a text message.

Lexi and I were halfway through a [cross-country roadtrip](leaf-url) that was taking all of our attention.

## Inception

- [Pinterest](https://pin.it/ocszhdomrxblat)
    - I am a man

![TODO](https://freight.cargo.site/w/607/i/b2cfbb7f1338b22301c858b5c44593b24810e3c614f41ca4f3b4626a7cd34de9/man6_o.jpg)

- Defining tone and messaging

- Paper sketches

- Figma sketches
    - Would have preferred not to; and just gone straight to Dan to hash it out, analog. Had to given the Sept 20 deadline and need to visualise on Kickstarter.
    - Kept it as short as possible and stressed the nature of change on Kickstarter

- Deciding feasible printing options
- Artwork for campaign, Instagram

## Going with letterpress
The Arm, specifically Dan who runs the join, was by far the most receptive and flexible.

## Printing
Paper was a snafu. So we went to print in two parts.

- More printing photos from later run(s)
- Car shot



## In retrospect
I dont' regret the visual simplicity of the posters. Yes, we were too time and resource sconstrainted to do anyhting more intricate—but the execution matches the message.

Perhaps we could have scouted similar efforts sooner, such as 350.org's art builds that were occuring weekends prior to the march.
