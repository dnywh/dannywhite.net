## What
Modular enough to change over time. Unpretentious; little-to-no third-person. Lite on self-promotion also because how I see myself is always changing. A living swipefile or dashboard.

## Dynamism
Unlike printed paper, the grain of the web is ever-changing.  This doesn't seem to be reflected beyond page content, though. At least the websites I've visited. What about styling? _Arrangement_ of content? The usefulness of these changes isn't tested, and though their impact may be minor, a personal website is nice place to experiment with them. And it's fun.

- Night theme for post-sunset reading (I usually turn on Safari Reader with dark mode for sites in the night)
- Multiple colour palettes that change on page load or over time (crossfade every ~1 min)
  - Colour palettes for day (dark blue on light blue, dark orange on light orange, dark teal on light teal)
  - Colour palettes for night (white on black, light purple on dark purple)
  - WCAG Accessibility rating for each of these

### Showing context of dynamism
Especially something like night mode. Should there be a module for date/time (my date/time or the reader's?). Can context be set by something personal to me? How I typically feel on Mondays? Monday `*` November `*` Cold in NYC?

## Modularity
I really like CSS Grid. I also like that it's extremely [well supported](https://alistapart.com/article/the-story-of-css-grid-from-its-creators). I don't like 'accidental' or 'leftover' negative space. Can my wants of a modular site work visually with grid?
