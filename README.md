# [dannywhite.is](http://dannywhite.is/)
Hi. Welcome to my site. I'm keeping this open because 1. I'm too stingy to pay for GitHub and 2. I've put quite a lot of work into this that might be useful for others.

This site uses [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) (actually all github.io sites do).

## Notable features
Things I've added onto or tweaked from the standard Jekyll theme, layouts, includes, etc:

- `image.html` include for inserting HTML `figure` elements, with automatic image directory hjandling
- auto-forwarding pages (e.g. [dannywhite.is/making](dannywhite.is/making))
- Open Graph in Jekyll
- Prettify URL slugs
- Extensive favicons
- Responsive `iframe` elements

Almost all of these features are derived from other peoples' articles or examples. They will eventually have their origin attributed, and usage extrapolated here.
